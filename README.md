This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website, available at https://manas.work.gd/. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a custom-animated night campsite scene, interactive navigation bubbles, and sections for contact, resume, and about info. Designed from scratch, the site reflects my interest in practical, creative web design with a minimal yet playful user experience. Youâ€™ll find all assets and scripts for deployment or customization within this repo.
